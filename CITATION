    abstract = {Summary: We created a fast, robust and general C++
        implementation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set
        enrichment algorithm to identify cell types, tissues and pathways
        affected by risk loci. It tests trait-associated genomic loci for
        enrichment of specificity to conditions (cell types, tissues and
        pathways). We use a non-parametric statistical approach to compute
        empirical P-values by comparison with null SNP sets. As a proof of
        concept, we present novel applications of our method to four sets of
        genome-wide significant SNPs associated with red blood cell count,
        multiple sclerosis, celiac disease and HDL cholesterol.Availability
